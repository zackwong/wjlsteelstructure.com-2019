<p>It is a comprehensive problem to choose a suitable method to cool down the <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> workshop. To solve this problem, we need to find the key factors that affect the temperature of the steel structure workshop, focus on its treatment, and deal with other relatively minor factors to achieve a good indoor environment and the highest cost performance.</p>
<p>In order to cool down the steel structure workshop, we should consider the following problems:</p>
<p>How is the thermal insulation performance of steel structure workshop?</p>
<p>Does the steel structure plant have a cooling system?</p>
<p>What is the ventilation performance of steel structure workshop?</p>
<p>1. Ventilation and cooling of steel structure workshop:</p>
<p>Due to the heat and water vapor generated by some machines in the steel structure workshop, if these hot gases and water vapor are not discharged in time, they will accumulate in the workshop, so that the temperature rise of the steel structure workshop will affect the environment of the steel structure workshop. The solution to these problems is to ensure the reasonable ventilation of the plant and install appropriate ventilation system. Reasonable installation of the exhaust system will obviously improve the air environment of the steel structure workshop and greatly reduce the temperature of the steel structure workshop.</p>
<p>Installation of roof forced exhaust fan</p>
<p>Power fan is a kind of ventilation equipment driven by electric power. It has good ventilation effect and can adapt to any environment.</p>
<p>The unpowered ventilator is a kind of ventilation equipment which depends on the principle of air convection. When there are differences in the indoor and outdoor air environment, it will produce air flow, so as to eliminate the indoor exhaust gas and hot air. Its advantage is that it does not need extra power and is more environmentally friendly. However, it has a strong dependence on the environment and cannot be forced to exhaust. The main products are turbine ventilator, strip ventilator (daylighting with ventilation), ridge ventilator, etc.</p>

<p>Forced cooling refers to the installation of a cold fan on the roof of the plant. The cold fan is a machine that uses the principle of water cooling to cool the air and the strong exhaust fan to deliver the cold air to the room. It can keep the indoor temperature of steel structure workshop at a comfortable temperature of 26-30 ℃. Its power consumption is equal to 1 / 8 of air conditioning. The cost is 1 / 2 of the air conditioner, which is a good method for forced cooling of factory buildings.</p>

<p>3. Thermal insulation and cooling of steel structure workshop:</p>
<p>The thermal insulation of steel structure workshop can insulate most of the solar radiation and heat conduction, and reduce the greenhouse effect in the room. Thus, the temperature of the workshop is greatly reduced and the environment of the steel structure workshop is improved. There are two commonly used methods: Covering the roof of the steel structure workshop with insulating cotton, and the insulating cotton used on the general roof is glass wool, with the thickness of 50mm and 75mm, 100mm, with a density of 64kg / m3; Generally, the indoor temperature can be reduced by 5-8 ℃ after installation, and the construction process is complex. If the old plant is to be reconstructed for heat preservation, the original roof needs to be removed and the steel wire mesh needs to be pulled. The glass wool needs to be laid on the steel wire mesh, the original roof panel needs to be covered, and then the waterproof treatment needs to be done.</p>
<p>Spray high efficient heat insulation and reflection coating on the roof panel. This product has excellent heat insulation performance and can be coated on metal, concrete, ash wall, wood structure surface, asbestos tile, plastic, FRP, rubber and other surfaces. The coating's thickness is 0.25mm, and its effect is equivalent to that of 250px-375px glass wool. It can reflect 99.5% infrared, 92.5% visible light, the highest sound insulation effect is 68%, and the average sound insulation effect is more than 50%. It is fire class A and completely non combustible. It is non-toxic, safe, long-term and durable, with a service life of more than 15 years (refer to engineering material file for detailed introduction). If this method is used, the construction is convenient. And there is no damage to the original roof, and the aging of the roof can be prevented. After construction and before construction, the maximum temperature difference of the plate surface can reach 20 ℃, the indoor temperature difference can reach 8-10 ℃, and the energy consumption of the steel structure workshop can be sharply reduced by 30-70%.</p>
