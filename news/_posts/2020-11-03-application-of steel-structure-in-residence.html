<p>In modern production, steel structure houses are getting more closer to our lives. Compared with other structures-brick-concrete structure and concrete structure, steel structure has advantages in use function, design, construction, and comprehensive economy. The advantages of applying steel structure in residential buildings are mainly reflected in the following aspects:</p>
<p>1. Able to arrange functional areas reasonably</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the high strength of steel, the design can be designed with large bays, so that the building plane can be reasonably separated, flexible and convenient, and create open houses. The traditional structure (brick-concrete structure, concrete structure) restricts the freedom of space layout due to the nature of the material. In the past, the space is usually 3.2 meters, 3.4 meters, 3.6 meters. If it is too large, it will cause the thickness of the plate, the height of the beam, and the large column. , The phenomenon of "fat beams and fat columns" not only affects the appearance, but also increases the weight and costs. Buyers often change the position of the wall by themselves during the secondary decoration, which increases hidden dangers.</p>
<p>2. Light weight and good seismic performance</p>
<p>Building floors with the same building area have a light steel structure. According to comparison, the weight of a six-story light steel structure residence is only equivalent to the weight of a four-story brick-concrete structure residence. Moreover, steel is ductile and can better consume the energy brought by earthquakes, so it has good seismic performance and high structural safety.</p>
<p>3. Convenient construction and short construction period</p>
<p>Steel structural components can be manufactured in factory and installed on site. Due to the small amount of on-site work and less pollution to the surrounding environment, at the same time, the high degree of construction mechanization accelerates the construction speed. According to statistics, for buildings of the same area, the construction period of steel structures can be shortened by one-third compared with concrete structures, and formwork materials can be saved.</p>
<p>4. Low comprehensive cost</p>
<p>Because of its light weight, lower basic costs, lower overall materials, lower direct costs, short construction period, and reduced indirect costs, the overall cost is low.</p>
<p>5. Meet the requirements of residential industrialization and sustainable development</p>
<p>The steel structure is suitable for mass production in factories, with a high degree of industrialization, and can integrate advanced products such as energy saving, waterproofing, heat insulation, doors and windows, etc., and complete applications to integrate design, production, and construction, and improve the level of residential industrialization.</p>
<p>In summary, steel structure is suitable for innovative residential structural systems. The steel structure can be designed with different shapes, sizes, and spaces according to people's different aesthetics and different functional requirements. The manufacturer can complete it with high precision, high quality and high speed, so that the building can achieve both beautiful and economical effect. With the development of high technology, people's concepts and lifestyles will also be constantly updated and changed, and the requirements for the overall quality of the house will also continue to increase. For this reason, the design of the house must consider coordination and adaptation with these changing factors. And a new world of flexible design emerges. The steel structure is the most suitable structural system for the flexible design of residential buildings.</p>
