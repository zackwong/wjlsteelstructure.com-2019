description: The characteristics of steel selected according to various factors of steel structure shall comply with requirement and stipulation of relevant standard.

<p>In order to ensure the bearing capacity of the <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> and prevent brittle failure under certain conditions, it should be considered according to the importance of the steel structure, load characteristics, structural form, stress state, connection method, steel thickness, working environment and so on. We should choose suitable steel grade and material properties.</p>
<p>The steel of load-bearing structure should adopt Q235 steel, Q345 steel, Q390 steel and Q420 steel, and the quality should conform to the current national standard "carbon structural steel" GB/T 700 and "low alloy high-strength structural steel" GB/T 1591. Provisions. When other grades of steel are used, they should also comply with the relevant standards and requirements. For Q235 steel, it is advisable to use killed steel or semi-killed steel.</p>
<p>The steel of the load-bearing structure shall have the qualification guarantee of tensile strength, elongation, yield strength and sulfur and phosphorus content, and the welding structure shall have the qualification guarantee of carbon content.</p>
<p>Steels bearing the load-bearing structure and important non-welded load-bearing structures shall also have a qualification guarantee for the cold bend test.</p>
<p>For steels that need to be tested for fatigued welded structures, they should have a qualification guarantee for normal temperature impact toughness. When the structural working temperature is equal to or lower than 0 °C but higher than -20 °C, Q235 steel and Q345 steel should have the qualification guarantee of 0 °CC impact toughness; Q390 steel and Q420 steel should have the qualification guarantee of -20 °C impact toughness. . When the working temperature of the structure is equal to or lower than -20 °C, Q235 steel and Q345 steel should have the qualification guarantee of -20 °C impact toughness; Q390 steel and Q420 steel should have the qualification guarantee of -40 °C impact toughness.</p>
<p>For non-welded structural steels that need to be checked for fatigue, they should also have the guarantee of normal temperature impact toughness. When the structural working temperature is equal to or lower than -20 °C, Q235 steel and Q345 steel should have the guarantee of 0°C impact toughness; Q390 steel and Q420 steel should have a qualification guarantee of -20 °C impact toughness.</p>
<p>When the Z-direction steel is used to prevent the laminar tearing of the steel, the material of the welding load-bearing structure shall comply with the current national standard "Thickness-oriented performance steel plate" GB/T 5313.</p>
<p>The design value of the strength of the steel (the standard value of the material strength divided by the resistance partial factor) shall be adopted according to Table 1-1 according to the thickness or diameter of the steel. The strength design value of steel castings shall be as shown in Table 1-2. The strength design values of the connections shall be in accordance with Tables 1-3 through 1-5.</p>

<p>Note: 1. In a structure subjected to a static load, only the slenderness ratio of the tension member in the vertical plane can be calculated.</p>

<p>3. The slenderness ratio of the lower chord of the medium and heavy duty crane truss should not exceed 200.</p>
<p>4. In workshops with hard-hook cranes such as clamps or rigid magazines, the length-to-length ratio of the support (except item 2 in the table) should not exceed 300.</p>
<p>5. When the tension member is pressed under the combination of permanent load and wind load, the slenderness ratio should not exceed 250.</p>
<p>6. For trusses with a span of 60m or more, the ratio of the length of the chord and the web should not exceed 300 (withstand static load or indirect dynamic load) or 250 (directly with dynamic load).</p>

<p>Note: 1. The compressed web of the truss (including the space truss) allows the slenderness ratio to be 200 when the internal force is equal to or less than 50% of the carrying capacity.</p>
<p>2. When calculating the slenderness ratio of the single-angle steel compression member, the minimum radius of gyration of the angle steel should be used. However, when calculating the slenderness ratio outside the plane of the cross-bar member, the radius of gyration parallel to the angle of the angled steel limb can be used.</p>
<p>3. For trusses with a span of 60m or more, the allowable slenderness ratio of the compressed chord and the end strut should be taken as 100, and the other compressed webs can be taken as 150 (with static load or indirect dynamic load) or 120 (direct Withstand dynamic loads).</p>

<p>Note: 1. d0 is the diameter of the bolt or rivet, and t is the thickness of the outer thinner plate.</p>
<p>2. The maximum spacing of bolts or rivets connected to the edge of the steel plate and rigid members (such as angle steel, channel steel, etc.) can be used as the value of the middle row.</p>
<p>The approximate values of the radius of gyration of common sections and their combined sections are shown in Table 1-15.</p>
