<p><b><a href="{{ site.url }}">Steel Structure</a> Budget Precautions</b></p>
<p>1. The materials must be distinguished,different steel materials have different prices (such as ordinary profile steel, Z / C steel, ordinary steel and angle steel, etc., the price should be calculated separately, should not be packed together)</p>
<p>2. Pay attention to whether the steel used in the quota is consistent with the material in the quota, and whether the content is consistent. If it is inconsistent, it should be adjusted.</p>
<p>3. It is specified that all steel structural members must be painted with fireproof coatings, and small components cannot be missed.</p>
<p>4. The connection way of steel structure nodes must be specified, then the construction process can not be missed.</p>
<p><b>The main reasons which influence the steel structure cost</b></p>
<p>1. The conservative degree of design.</p>
<p>2. Market material prices.</p>
<p>3. The level of the construction team (directly affects the loss and speed of production, transportation, installation).</p>
<p>4. Fireproof coatings are not a small expense.</p>
