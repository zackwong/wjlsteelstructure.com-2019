<p>1.2 Steel structure anticorrosion</p>
<p>In order to ensure the construction quality, all component materials should be blasted and rusted before cutting to meet the design requirements. The blasting and rusting should meet the Sa2.5 level standard "Steel surface corrosion level and rust removal level before painting. (GB8923-88), the roughness reaches 30 ～ 75μm, anti-rust primer is sprayed immediately within 5 hours after sand blasting. The paint type and film thickness requirements are determined according to design documents.</p>

<p>1.5 Component identification</p>
<p>According to the structure of the product, the labels are mainly the center mark of the component, the 1m elevation line mark, the project name, the component number, and the company name mark.</p>
<p>1.5.1 Marking</p>
<p>1) The centerline mark is shown in the figure a below, and the 1 meter elevation line mark is shown in the figure b.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2) The triangle mark is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 50mm, and the interior filling color is white.</p>
<p>3) The relative positional relationship between the triangle mark in the centerline mark and the elevation line mark and the ocean punching eye is shown in Figure c.</p>
<p>4) Except where noted, the font is in Song style, the word spacing is 25mm, and the size is 60x60mm.</p>
<p>1.5.2 Component identification of steel beams</p>
<p>1) The project name and component number are sprayed on the web plate 500mm from the left end of the H steel beam. If the arch is marked, the top surface should be marked. The specific diagram is as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2) When painting, spray the company's logo in the middle of the steel beam, the font is Song, the letter spacing is 30mm, and the size is 180 × 180mm (height × width). Check indicators are the orientation and font size of the company name logo.</p>
