<p>Now that <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> houses are slowly entering the public's field of vision, people will no longer have the first impression of a brick-concrete structure when building a house. More and more people are starting to build steel structure houses, and many people don't understand how much the steel structure costs per square meter. WanJinLong Company will introduce it to you below.</p>

<p>1. What is the steel structure?</p>
<p>Steel structure is currently one of the main types of building structures. It is mainly composed of beams, steel columns, steel trusses and other components made of steel and steel plates. Which use silanization, pure manganese phosphating, washing and drying, galvanizing, etc to derusting and antirust, and then the components or parts are usually connected by welding, bolts or rivets. Due to its light weight and easy construction, steel structures are currently widely used in the construction of large-scale factory buildings, stadiums, and super high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>2. What is the cost per square meter of steel structure?</p>
<p>2.1 First of all, the price of steel structure workshops should be based on their actual conditions: the manufacturer, thickness, and coating of the color-coated sheet; the material and thickness of the thermal insulation layer; the presence of skylights; the opening and the span of the workshop; Many factors have a great relationship, in addition, price differences between regions and the qualification level of the construction unit also have an impact.</p>
<p>2.2 The cost is mainly related to the use of steel beams, specifically how many kilograms of steel is multiplied by the price of steel, plus the cost of steel production, plus the non-steel structure and civil and water and electricity prices. This part is about dozens of yuan.</p>
<p>2.3 Steel structure roof trusses are more expensive than thin web beams. The cost also fluctuates according to the market price of steel. For example, calculated at 1,000 yuan per square meter, it costs 800,000, and steel roof truss structure requires 1 million. However, the specific budget must be calculated according to the local prices and the specific content of the steel house design.</p>
<p>2.4. Steel structure workshops have various structural forms. The general shed structure is about 250 yuan, the general light steel structure workshop is about 600 yuan, and the advanced height is 9 meters to 12 meters, and the cost is about 750 to 1,000 yuan per square meter.</p>

<p>3. What are the characteristics of steel structure buildings?</p>
<p>3.1 High strength and light weight</p>
<p>The strength of the steel is high and the elastic modulus is also high. Compared with concrete and wood, the ratio of the density to the strength of steel is lower. Therefore, under the same stress conditions, the steel structure has a small cross-section, light weight, and is more convenient for transportation and installation. It suit for structures with large spans, high heights and heavy loads.</p>
<p>3.2 Good toughness and high reliability</p>
<p>Steel is suitable for shock and dynamic loads and has excellent seismic performance. Its internal tissue structure is uniform, close to an isotropic homogeneous body. The actual working performance is more in line with the calculation theory. Therefore, the steel structure has high reliability.</p>
<p>3.3 High degree of mechanization</p>
<p>Steel structural components are easy to fabricate at the factory and assembled on site. The factory mechanized manufacture of steel structure components has high precision, high production efficiency, fast assembly speed and short construction period. Steel structure is the most industrialized structure.</p>
<p>3.4 good sealing performance of steel structure</p>
<p>Because the steel structure is a welded structure, it can be completely sealed and made into high-pressure vessels, large oil tanks, pressure pipes, etc., which have good air tightness and water tightness.</p>
<p>3.5 Steel structure</p>
<p>When the temperature is below 150 ° C, the steel properties change little. Therefore, the steel structure is suitable for thermal workshops, but when the surface of the structure is exposed to heat at about 150 ° C, it is necessary to protect it with a heat shield. When the temperature is between 300 ° C and 400 ° C, the strength and elastic modulus of the steel are significantly reduced. When the temperature is around 600 ° C, the strength of the steel will tend to zero. In buildings with special fire protection requirements, refractory materials must be used for protection to improve fire resistance</p>
<p>3.6 Poor corrosion resistance</p>
<p>Steel is susceptible to corrosion in humid and corrosive environments. Generally, steel should be derusted, galvanized or painted, and regularly maintained. For offshore platform structures in seawater, special measures need to be taken to strengthen the corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>3.7 Environmental protection</p>
<p>Demolition of a steel structure building will hardly generate construction waste, and its steel can be recycled and reused, which is very environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>The above is for you to sort out the cost per square meter of steel structure, you can see that steel structure construction has many advantages. However, because the price of each area and the specific internal design layout of each building are different, the specific cost is also different, and the specifics are based on the local market. The above is only for reference.</p>
