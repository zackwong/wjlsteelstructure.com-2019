<p>(4)Extra-thick plates</p>
<p><b>3. Portal frame system-classification</b></p>
<p>According to the different parts of the portal frame light steel structure factory, it is divided as follows:</p>
<p>①Main steel structure: anchor bolts, steel columns, steel beams, Mezzanine beams, roof purlins, roof horizontal supports, roof pipe supports, corner supports, inter-purlin supports, diagonal rods, wall vertical supports, wall purlins, etc.</p>
<p>② Enclosure structure: roof panel, wall panel, sandwich panel, curtain wall panel, trim, etc.</p>
<p>3.1 Main Steel Structure——anchor bolt</p>
<p>The anchor bolts are generally made of Q235B round steel material, and the supporting components are 3 nuts, 1 gasket and 1 square pad. 3 nuts play different roles: leveling, tightening, and anti-loosening. The shear key at the bottom of the column generally uses No. 10 channel steel, and a 50mm secondary grouting layer is reserved between the column bottom plate and the foundation, and no shrinkage concrete is used. The foot of the column is 150mm in height. Pay attention to the relative position of the axis line when installing the anchor bolts.</p>

<p>3.2 Main steel structure——steel column, steel beam</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p align="center">Cutting and hole making construction    H-type Automatic submerged arc welding</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p align="center">Component section size inspection         Weld bead flaw detection</p>
<p>The main material of the steel plate that composes the steel column and steel beam is Q235B or Q345B, which is processed by the factory through cutting, drilling, assembly, welding, straightening, shot blasting, painting and other procedures. They are the main stress-bearing components of light steel structures, and the quality of production and installation directly affects the engineering quality and safety of the workshop. Therefore, the following content needs to be strictly controlled: raw materials, production accuracy, installation accuracy, etc.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
Steel columns: side columns, middle columns, wind-resistant columns, side beams, middle beams, ridge beams

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>3.3 Main steel structure ——Mezzanine beam</p>
<p>Mezzanine beams generally belong to the frame structure system. The main beam is rigidly connected to the steel column (secondary welding), and the secondary beam is hinged to the main beam (high-strength bolt connection).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-8.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>Meaning of welding symbols: single-sided (double-sided) fillet welds, equal-strength welds, full penetration welds, etc. On-site secondary full penetration welds require third-party sampling inspection.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-10.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>The torque value of high-strength bolt construction must meet the experimental data requirements, and the final tightening should not be omitted.</p>
<p>3.4 Main steel structure ——supporting system</p>

<p>Note: The support is the main force transmission structure of the steel structure and must be installed in strict accordance with the requirements of the drawing. The appropriate tension is generally controlled at 1/700L. Round pipe section size, mechanical properties, gasket, nut.</p>
<p>In logistics warehousing projects, it is generally forbidden to set up scissor supports at the center axis location, and they are usually designed as portal supports.</p>

<p>Paint purlin: Q235B steel is generally used. The surface should be rust-removal, and the thickness of the anti-rust paint is generally not less than 60um, which is factory processed and pre-punched.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-15.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>Z-shaped roof purlins are generally designed with continuous beams. Installation precautions: the same length and different thickness should not be mixed. The materials should be rainproof when they arrive at construction site, and they should be installed in time since they are easy to rust when stacked for a long time.</p>
