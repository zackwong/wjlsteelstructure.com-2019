<p><b>2. Sheet material</b></p>
<p>2.1 Groove processing</p>
<p>2.1.1 The processing of the groove is to cut the groove by flame cutting machine, and the surface of the groove after cutting should be cleaned. If other oxides are attached to the edge of the groove, the welding quality will also be affected, so it should be cleaned up;</p>
<p>2.1.2 The groove schematic diagram is as follows</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2.2 Welding</p>
<p>2.2.1 Before the welding work begins, use wire brush and grinder to remove oxides, rust, paint, oil and other harmful impurities in the range of at least 20mm near the weld;</p>
<p>2.2.2 The positioning welds shall not have defects; the length of the positioning welds shall be 40~50mm, the spacing of the weld bead shall be 150~200mm, and the craters shall be filled. There must be no defects such as cracks, slag inclusions, and welds in the tack weld. If there are defects such as blowholes and cracks on the spot weld, it must be cleaned and re-welded.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Both ends of straight butt joints must be welded with arc-extinguishing plates and arc-extinguishing plates. The arc-ignition and arc-extinguishing plates are important measures to ensure the quality of the welds at both ends. The welds can improve the formal welding through the transition of arc-extinguishing and arc-extinguishing plates. The welding temperature of the zone is to prevent defects such as incomplete penetration and unmelting at both ends of the weld, and also eliminate the crater at both ends of the weld and the crack in the crater. Therefore, the arc should be set at both ends of the weld. The material and thickness of the plate and the arc extinguishing plate shall be the same as the base material. The length of the arc striking plate and the arc extinguishing plate shall be greater than or equal to 80 mm, the width shall be greater than or equal to 60 mm, and the length of the welded joint shall be greater than or equal to 40mm, to ensure the quality of arc ignition and arcing, to prevent crater cracks.</p>
<p>2.2.4 After the steel plate is in place, do the anti-deformation work. Note that the deformation of the side of the first weld is usually larger than the deformation of the side of the post weld. After the reverse deformation, the end of the butt steel plate is fixed. During the welding process, pay attention to the deformation of the steel plate, and turn it over in time to avoid large angular deformation of the steel plate.</p>
<p>2.2.5 For steel plates with a thickness of 36 mm or more, before the butt joint, the welds should be preheated with a baking gun. The preheating temperature is 60-140 ° C (depending on the thickness of the plate), and the preheating range is 100 mm on both sides of the weld.</p>
<p>2.2.6 When the front bottom welding, pay attention to the welding wire to the center of the groove, use the appropriate welding line energy to avoid welding leakage.</p>
<p>2.2.7 Use multi-layer welding, pay attention to the cleaning of the inter-channel slag during the welding process; every weld should be inspected, and the deep groove formed on the edge of the parent metal of the groove should be ground with a grinding wheel until the covered bead can fully melt and penetrate; If it is found that the undercut, slag and other defects must be removed and repaired.</p>
<p>2.2.8 The back side does not need to use carbon arc gouging to clear the root, directly using high current welding to achieve the purpose of full penetration welding.</p>
<p>2.2.9 After the submerged arc welding is completed, the slag and spatter in the weld zone are carefully cleaned. After cooling, the arc striking plate and the arc extinguishing plate are cut and polished.</p>
<p>2.2.10 Submerged arc welding thick plate welding operation should be continuous welding, no intermittent welding is allowed, that is, welding is not allowed after a certain weld is welded for several hours.</p>
<p>2.2.11 When the thickness of the steel plate is 40mm＜T ≤ 60mm, after the welding is completed, slow cooling should be carried out, that is, after the welding is completed, the insulation cotton is used for slow cooling.</p>
<p>2.3 Welding inspection</p>
<p>All inspections must be completed after the weld has cooled to room temperature.</p>
<p>2.3.1 After welding, the appearance quality of the weld is checked by 100% appearance quality. Then, the internal quality inspection is carried out by ultrasonic flaw detection. The weld quality inspection standard is Grade 1: The internal defect classification of the joint should conform to the current national standard “Steel Weld Manual Provisions for ultrasonic flaw detection methods and classification of flaw detection results.</p>
<p>2.3.2 Check the dimensional deviation of the butt weld, and the weld size should conform to the current national standard "Structural dimensions of steel structure welds".</p>

<p>First, the base is made of CO2 gas shielded welding, and the thickness of the base is not less than 10mm, so that it can withstand the tensile stress caused by shrinkage deformation. After the bottom welding is completed, the weld is polished to remove debris such as welding slag and splash.</p>
<p>6.3 Electroslag welding</p>
<p>6.3.1 After the bottom welding is completed, the residual dirt in the electroslag welding hole is removed for electroslag welding.</p>
<p>6.3.2 The inner baffle adopts three-sided CO2 gas shielded welding and one side electroslag welding;</p>
<p>6.3.3 After the welding starts, the arc must be fully burned. The welding voltage should be 2-4V higher than the normal voltage during the start-up. During the welding process, the welding slag pool is formed and then drops to the normal welding voltage.</p>
<p>6.3.4 When the arc is closed, the welding current and voltage can be gradually reduced to prevent shrinkage cracking.</p>
<p>6.3.5 After the welding is completed, the weld slag should be cleaned and cleaned by CO2 gas shielded welding to the bottom welding and smoothed.</p>
<p>6.4 Box type body welding</p>
<p>After the electroslag welding is completed and the slag is cleaned together with the bottom welding, the main weld bead is fully automated submerged arc welded.</p>
<p>6.4.1 When submerged arc welding, the four longitudinal joints follow the same direction of the two welds on the same side, and the same standard welding principle is adopted to reduce the welding deformation of the components.</p>
<p>6.4.2 Because the full penetration weld bevel at the joint is inconsistent with the semi-melting groove, it can be repaired to the same level as the semi-penetrated weld and then filled and welded, and always consistent to create conditions for the cover, cover bead The non-broken arc should be welded once and continuously. If the weld bead is too wide, it can be divided into sections.</p>
<p>6.4.3 After the welding is completed, the defects such as the weld bead and the vent hole are cleaned, so that the arc-extinguishing plate is cut off after cooling to normal temperature, and the smoothing is smoothed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-22.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>6.4.4 The welding of the main weld is carefully done in the welding record, and the welder's mark is placed after the welding is completed.</p>
<p>6.4.5 Check the box size, shape, and weld size tolerances as shown in the following table:</p>

<p><b>7. Box type body flame correction</b></p>
<p>7.1 The box column is welded. After it is completely cooled, it will be bent and deformed. It should be corrected. The box body is generally flame corrected. When the flame is corrected, the temperature value should be controlled between 750 and 900 °C. The heating correction of the same part should not exceed 2 times. After the correction, it should be slowly cooled. The low alloy steel should not be quenched with water.</p>
<p>7.2 Flame correction is the use of flame to locally heat the steel, so that the heating part is compressed and plastically deformed due to expansion, so that the longer metal fiber is cooled and shortened.</p>
<p>7.3 The position of the flame heating should be selected in the longer part of the metal fiber. The heating form is generally available, local point heating and triangular heating. The point heating position is the central part of the local convex deformation, and the triangular heating position and shape are as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-30.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>7.4 The height of the triangle heating and the width of the bottom are 1\5~2\3 of the height of the profile. Different heating heat can be used to obtain different correction ability. When the low carbon steel member is used for flame correction, the heating temperature of 600~800 °C is often used.</p>
<p>Low alloy steel heating temperature is 750~900 °C, slow cooling, no water cooling.</p>
<p><b>8. End milling</b></p>
<p>8.1 Check the main part of the box type column for the qualified mark. Place the box type main body on the workpiece support of the end mill, so that the column bus bar is perpendicular to the end face milling cutting plane, and then clamp the box column main body.</p>
<p>8.2 The end face of the box type is machined according to the size requirement, the surface roughness is required to be 0.03mm, and the flatness is required to be 0.3. The allowable deviation of the perpendicularity is not more than 1.5H/1000, and H is the length of the section.</p>
<p>8.3 When the lower column is made, the top end needs to be milled. When the upper column is made, the bottom of the column needs to be welded to the ground:</p>

<p><b>9. Box type column and component assembly welding</b></p>
<p>9.1 After checking the end milled components and parts with the drawings, the steel stamps shall be marked on the adjacent sides of the end 500mm from the end. The stamp shall be clear and clear. It is not allowed to have a delineation. If there is an error in the stamp number, the original stamp number must be removed and the stamp should be re-printed. The steel stamp is circled with a white paint stroke.</p>
<p>9.2 Draw the center line of the box-type body, and then use the top-end milling surface of the box-type column as the reference. According to the drawing size, the end plate and the ox leg are attached, the positioning welding is firm, and the inspection personnel are inspected. Only after the qualification is passed, the welding construction is allowed.</p>
<p>9.3 Welding construction, welding is completed according to the drawings and process requirements. Defects such as splashes and welds are removed after the welding is completed.</p>
