<p>We often see such a plot in the movie that the male and female protagonists "toast to invite the moon" in the <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> container house, which is full of romantic atmosphere. Nowadays, container house is no longer a fresh thing. In the eyes of some avant-garde fashionists, container houses represent a sense of modernity and simplicity. Especially in some places where young people gathered, container houses have been transformed into specialty shops, specialty hotels and etc. In the eyes of some business people, container houses represent convenience, economy and affordability. In some project construction sites, the installation period is two or three years or even longer. Used as an office or dormitory, the container house is at least stronger than the prefab house in safety, and cheaper than the steel structure and the brick house. At the same time, it is also convenient to move, and can be transported by the car after the end of the installation. Therefore, such flat pack container houses are often used for commercial and industrial purposes such as offices and dormitories. But is it really feasible to use container houses as our own long-term housing? Will you live in such a house?</p>

<p>The steel structure container house is creative. It also has many advantages: the modularity of the container can make the construction quick and flexible; as a temporary building, the approval procedure is relatively simple and in some areas, the formalities is even unnecessary; It is small but complete, the container houses can also meet a variety of daily needs through clever and reasonable design; The creative appearance also can make people please.</p>
<p>The size of standard wanjinlong steel strucure living container is 6 m * 2.435 m * 2.896 m (it is considered based on profile and transportation), and the length and width can be increased by connection of several containers. The container house donâ€™t need any decoration, and people can live in directly at any time. For example, as for our Japanese container project, since it was used as a double-layer high-end office, the standard is higher. The treatment of fire, heat and moisture was much more detailed. The heat-insulation treatment was make in both top and bottom structure, and the internal and external wall was decorated with decorative panels. All the water, electrical system and supporting facilities were all equipped according to the standard.</p>

<p>Layout and safety: The previous EPS sandwich wall panel and single-layer iron wall plate were gradually replaced by grade A fire-resistant color steel rock wool and glass wool sandwich wall panels. Nowadays,the high-end residential containers can be equipped with separate toilets, open kitchens, air-conditioning, refrigerators, microwave ovens,lighting system and etc. People can choose the patterns of  1 bedroom 1 livingroom, 2 bedrooms 1 livingroom, 3bedrooms 1livingroom, 3 bedrooms 2 livirngrooms according to their needs. They just need to buy enough containers for assembly.</p>
<p>Price: The cost of one normal standard container house is less than USD3000. and the freight cost is calculated according to real-time. If you purchase multiple container houses at the same time for connection, you can save a part of the cost (it will be calculated according to the layout of the house). Due to the completion of the welding process, the container house has a maximum service life of 25-30 years.</p>
<p>In summary, Living comfortably will cost more.As a simple residential house,the container house itself is very easy. If you want to improve the comfort, the cost of the transformation is inevitably very expensive (compared to the container itself). At this time, the purpose of the container will be very important. If it is used as a temporary office or commercial building, the standard container house will be enough and the luxury decoration is unnecessary.If it is for long-term living, and in consideration of land and decoration cost, I personally think that it is not suitable as a durable House.</p>
