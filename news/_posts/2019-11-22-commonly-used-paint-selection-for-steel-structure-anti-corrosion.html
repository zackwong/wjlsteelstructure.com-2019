<p><b>1. Selection for anti-corrosion paint</b></p>
<p>After the surface of the derusted steel is inspected, it shall be painted within the required time limit. The anti-rust coating should generally consist of a primer, an intermediate paint and a finishing coat. The choice of paint should be based on the matching of the paint and the derusting grade, and the matching combination of the primer and the finishing coat.</p>
<p>1.1 Commonly used paint</p>
<p>The performance, application, paint methods and accessory requirements of commonly used anti-rust primers, finishing coats and anti-corrosion paints are listed in the below table.</p>

<p><b>2. Galvanized</b></p>
<p>2.1 Overview</p>
<p>Galvanized refers to a surface treatment technique that coats a layer of zinc on the surface of a metal, alloy or other material to achieve the effect of aesthetics, rust prevention, and etc. Can be divided into two types: hot galvanized and cold galvanized. The main method currently used is hot galvanized.</p>
<p>2.2 Classification</p>
<p>2.2.1 Hot galvanized</p>
<p>Hot galvanized, also known as hot-dip galvanized, is a method that the steel components present a non-staining and wetting surface after surface oil and rust removal and then immediately been immersed in a plating tank that has been previously melted by zinc to form a surface of galvanized . The hot-dip galvanized coating is thicker, generally 30-60 microns, and the coating has a higher corrosion resistance. It is suitable for the steel components outdoor, such as highway fences, power towers, large-size fasteners and other relatively "rough" workpieces for long-term rust prevention. The older iron pipes are also hot-dip galvanized.</p>
<p>2.2.2 Cold galvanized</p>
<p>Also known as electroplating zinc, is a method that the steel components present a non-staining and wetting surface after surface oil and rust removal and then hung on the cathode of a special plating tank, and the anode is made of zinc., and when the DC power is turned on, the zinc ions on the anode migrate to the cathode, and discharge on the cathode, so that it is plated with a zinc layer. The surface of the cold-galvanized workpiece is smooth and flat, but because the coating is relatively thin, generally within 5-30 microns, the corrosion prevention time will be shorter. They are used for rust prevention of indoor parts, such as chassis bottoms, panels, and small-sized fasteners.</p>
<p>2.3 Quality characteristics</p>
<p>Smooth appearance, no zinc, burr, silvery white; thickness is controllable, arbitrarily selected within 5-107μm; no hydrogen embrittlement, no temperature hazard, can ensure the mechanical properties of the material unchanged; can replace some parts need hot-dip galvanized process; good corrosion resistance, neutral salt spray test can last for 240 hours.</p>
<p>2.4 Application range</p>
<p>Mainly used in steel nails, nails, fasteners, water pipe joints, scaffolding fasteners, wire rope horse steel chucks. In recent years, with the development of galvanized technology and the use of high-performance galvanizing brighteners, galvanized has entered the protective-decorative application from the purely protective purpose.</p>
