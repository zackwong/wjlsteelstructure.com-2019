<p>Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was founded in 1163 and completed in 1345. The total height of Notre Dame Cathedral is over 130 meters. It is the first completely Gothic Church in European history. It has epoch-making significance and is also the longest and most representative historic site in Paris. It has been listed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO. It was badly damaged during the French Revolution and rebuilt in the 19th century. Such an ancient building with a history of more than 850 years collapsed in the fire around 6:50 p.m. local time on April 15, 2019. French billionaire Franois Henry Pino said he would invest 100 million euros (about 760 million yuan) to help rebuild Notre Dame in Paris. For the reconstruction of Notre Dame in Paris, people all over the world have different ideas.</p>
<p>Stephen Murray, an art historian at Columbia University, pointed out that Notre Dame de Paris could not be completely restored: the stone of the 12th century was hand-cut by craftsmen, a process that is hard to find today. The timber used on roofs has a history of thousands of years and is hard to find today. Smith believes that the reconstruction of Notre Dame in Paris also has two ideas. In accordance with the principles of the 1964 Venice Charter and with full respect for the original structure, the missing parts can be filled with minimal intervention.</p>
<p>Or, you can refer to accurate historical records, illustrations and photographs (even the 3D digital archives left behind) and use modern technology to reconstruct Notre Dame de Paris accurately and in accordance with the spirit of architecture.</p>
<p>so I thought that if the Notre Dame de Paris was renovated, the latest modern technology, <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a>, could be used for renovation, just like the Eiffel Tower (French: La Tour).R Eiffel is a hollow structure iron tower built in 1889 on the Plaza of Ares in Paris, France. It is 324m high totally: 300 meters high on body and 24 meters high on antenna. The Sailing Hotel in Dubai, the Morpheus Hotel in Macau, as well as Bird's Nest in China, the new 600-meter TV Tower in Guangzhou, Sheraton Hotel, high-rise residential residences, etc. All kinds of steel structures have sprung up.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>The steel structure can meet the needs of different levels of design from the aesthetic point of view and the height. The main reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The production cycle is short.</p>
<p>2. Assembled accurately and quickly from the beginning to the completion.</p>
<p>3. The vibration (earthquake) resistance and impact resistance of steel are good.</p>
<p>4. The sealing performance of steel structure is good.</p>
<p>5. The heat resistance is high.</p>
<p>6. The material strength is high, the weight is lighter.</p>
<p>7. The plasticity and toughness are good.</p>
<p><b>We hope Notre Dame de Paris will stand on French again in a short time and be famous for its unique way in the world!</b></p>
