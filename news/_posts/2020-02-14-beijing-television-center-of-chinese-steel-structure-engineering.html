<p>1. Basic situation of the project</p>
<p>Project location: No. 98 Jianguo Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing</p>
<p>Construction cost: 1.44 billion</p>
<p>Building area: 202,000 square meters</p>
<p>Building height: 249m</p>
<p>Structure type: giant steel frame structure system, frame shear wall</p>
<p>Commencement date: December 12, 2002</p>
<p>Completion Date: September 26, 2008</p>
<p>2. Project introduction:</p>
<p>The Beijing TV Center project is located at the extension of East Changan Street and the core of the CBD. It is an important supporting project of the Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games and one of the 60 key projects in Beijing. The center integrates TV program production, broadcasting, transmission and multi-functional services as a whole. The total building area is 202,000 m2. The overall shape is novel, chic, and elegant. It is one of the most complete and high-standard design of TV broadcasting system.</p>
<p>The ultra-high-rise pure steel mega-frame structural system is the first application in China, and creatively adopts advanced prestressing technology, so that the installation level of China's mega-frame structural system ultra-high-rise steel structure has reached a new level. For the first time, China's self-developed large-scale hydraulic climbing frame and construction safety protection technology were used to fill the gap of domestic hydraulic climbing frames in the construction of ultra-high-rise <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structures</a>, and reached the international leading level. Without leaving any form of joints and belts, one-time continuous casting molding, and finding out a set of scientific and feasible ultra-long ultra-thick mass-free concrete mass crack control comprehensive construction technology, which provides reliable technical support for similar projects.</p>
<p>Beijing Television Center has the largest shared atrium in the world, making full use of space resources and natural light resources. Different electric shading systems are installed on the roof according to the orientation to reduce the energy consumption of the air conditioner and achieve the purpose of energy saving.</p>
<p>As a media center in the digital age, Nortel's electromechanical equipment covers more than thirty systems, all of which are environmentally-friendly equipment that can meet the requirements of 24-hour uninterrupted playback functions, fully reflecting the characteristics of intelligent buildings in the 21st century. Architectural acoustics requirements for studios, recording and dubbing studios are very high, all of which are designed as "rooms in rooms", and their sound insulation limits have reached international advanced levels. The system's multifunctionality and high efficiency realize the integrated management of facilities and energy.</p>
