<p>2.4 Welding quality control measures</p>
<p>2.4.1 Welding deformation control</p>
<p>1）Welding deformation control</p>
<p>a. Use reasonable welding sequence to control deformation</p>
<p>For butt joint, T-joint and cross joint bevel welding, when the workpiece placement conditions are allowed or easy to turn over, it is advisable to use double-sided bevel symmetrical sequentially welding;</p>
<p>For double-sided asymmetric bevel welding, the order of welding should be: welding the partial welds on the deep bevel side firstly, then the shallow bevel side , and finally welds all the deep bevel side weld;</p>
<p>Jump welding method should be adopted to avoid localized heating of the workpiece</p>
<p>Weld the middle firstly and then both sides;</p>
<p>Weld rods with high stress firstly and then rods with low stress;</p>
<p>Weld the tension rod firstly and then the compression rod;</p>
<p>b. In the case where the joint form, weld arrangement and welding sequence are determined, a welding method with a relatively high energy density should be used, and a small heat input should be used.</p>
<p>c. Angular deformation should be controlled by inverse deformation method.</p>
<p>2.4.2 Welds inspection measures</p>
<p>After welding is completed, the slag on the surface and spatters on both sides should be cleaned and weld inspection shall be carried out. The inspection method shall be in accordance with DBJ08-216-95 and JGJ81-2002.</p>
