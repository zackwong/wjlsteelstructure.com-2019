---
<p>We try to actively promote green buildings, vigorously develop light <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> houses, improve the standards and quality of construction projects, improve the living environment of the people, and make the people live more peacefully and comfortably. For fresh things, everyone will definitely have all kinds of doubts. The following will solve these problems for everyone.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>Question: What are the advantages of light steel construction over traditional homes?</p>
<p>Answer: Compared with brick-and-mortar houses, the light steel structure can avoid the waste of resources caused by earth-fired bricks. And because the wall thickness of the light steel structure is small, the effective use area can be increased compared with the brick-concrete structure. Compared with reinforced concrete houses, light steel structure can be recycled, and concrete can not be recycled, and it will definitely be construction waste in the future, causing environmental pressure. Moreover, the concrete takes a long time to be completely dried, so it is easy to cause indoor moisture, which is not conducive to human health.</p>
<p>Light steel structure has better seismic performance. Because the earthquake activity is left and right and up and down, the steel structure tightly connected by galvanized bolts constitutes a safe and stable box, and the wall will not collapse due to the shaking of the earthquake. Falling floor slabs endanger personal safety.</p>
<p>The dry construction method of light steel structure construction will not cause waste of water resources and save corresponding costs.</p>

<p>Question: Can light steel structure houses handle real estate licenses? What are the procedures for running the department?</p>
<p>Answer: Steel structure houses can not do real estate licenses, and has nothing to do with the house itself. There is a great relationship with the nature of the land. The policies in each region are different. Many of our customers have also applied for real estate licenses. Like many civil engineering projects, it is not always possible to carry out real estate licenses. This issue has a lot to do with the local government.</p>
<p>Question: How to install the heating equipment in the light steel structure house?</p>
<p>Answer: If it is an ordinary radiator, it can be fixed directly on the wall. If it is floor heating, the floor heating can be installed on the cement pressure plate, which is no different from the traditional building.</p>

Additional items can also be added according to the special requirements of the owner.</p>
<p>Question: What is the general price of light steel structure houses?</p>
<p>Answer: There is a general offer for houses with ordinary shapes and no special structure. For houses with complex structural shapes and special requirements, it is not suitable for general quotation. Whether it is ordinary or has special requirements, the exact quotation will be calculated according to the drawings.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a relationship between the height and price of light steel houses? What is the general height?</p>
<p>Answer: There will be a certain relationship, because the difference in height will result in different materials usage and working hours. The height of each floor is generally 2.5-3.4 meters per floor. The price is higher than your design.</p>
<p>Question: What materials are mainly used on the second floor of light steel houses? Can it be shock-absorbing, soundproof and waterproof.</p>
<p>Answer: There are two ways to do the second floor of a light steel house. 1 Pour the concrete floor on the basis of the cement fiber board, and then lay the tile, wooden floor or carpet. 2 After the waterproofing treatment is done on the basis of the cement fiberboard, the wooden floor or carpet is directly laid. There is nothing wrong with both approaches to waterproofing. the sound insulation layer is also formed between the ceiling of the first floor and the second floor.</p>
<p>Question: What is the live load of the second floor and roof of a light steel house? What is the wall?</p>
<p>Answer: The wind pressure on the wall is 0.4KN/M2 (40 kg), the constant load on the roof is 0.35KN/M2 (35 kg), and the live load on the roof is 0.5KN/M2 (50 kg). This value is the design standard for the East China region. Different values will change. The ground live load on the second floor is 0.31-0.36KN/M2 (310kg-360kg). If you have special needs, we can increase or decrease your design.</p>
