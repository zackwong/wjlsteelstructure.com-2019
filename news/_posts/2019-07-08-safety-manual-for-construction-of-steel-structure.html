<p><b>1.Safety measures</b></p>

<p>1.2 Employees should wear insulated shoes, clothes, gloves and shoes should keep dry.</p>
<p>1.3 Electric tools should use cable tray, leakage protector or grounding measures, and make regular inspection according to regulations.</p>

<p>1.11 Every day before work, the monitor organizes a pre-class meeting to talk about safety, quality, progress requirements, and records. The supervisor should attend the meeting regularly.</p>
<p>1.12 Every day, when the work is finished, the material should be clean and the site should be clear and the fire source should be extinct and the power supply should be cut off.</p>

<p>2.1 Tents, distribution boxes, materials, etc. should be placed in accordance with the requirements of the general plan of construction work.</p>
<p>2.2 The determination of the general plan of steel structure construction operation shall be communicated with Party A before it is determined. Once it is determined, it shall be carried out conscientiously and no further changes shall be made.</p>
<p>2.3 For daily necessities used by employees, baggage should be placed uniformly and reasonably.</p>
<p>2.4 After entering the field, the materials should be stored according to specifications and models, and the wooden square should be used to pad up more than 100 mm, and the yard should be neatly placed. It is strictly forbidden to pile up and put in disorder, to contact with corrosive substances, and to take rainproof measures.</p>
