---

<p>We have being busy to complete the design and quotation of the <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> for the old client in Thailand since last night to this afternoon!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the unity of our engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steelstructureengineering/">Peter<a/> and CNO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steelstructurestorage/ ">Ms. Wendy Wang</a> which really stand in Thailand client’s shoes:</p>
<p>Due to Thailand client is our old friend, they only put forward to few rough requirements:</p>
<p>"The size of the warehouse is: 15m*84m*8m", "The steel structure need to meet the load of 80kg/m2", "The crane load capacity of 5 tons need to be designed in the warehouse", "The fence with 2.8 high around the #steelstruturewarehouse is ok" etc.</p>
<p>Without a few words, our engineer Peter owned over 13 years long professional working experience has made a preliminary design and quotation based on the above blurred needs with confidence, and Peter did not ignore the late tracking hunt.</p>
<p>At noon today, Thailand time 10:10 a.m.,Peter called directly: "Hello sir, How are you today? Are you busy?"</p>
<p>A slowly return "No, I am drinking coffee."</p>
<p>"That’s great, you like coffee, and Chinese like tea, both of them are enjoyed for us."</p>
<p>"yes, just relax for a moment here", just like a coffee addict.</p>
<p>"I see, but now there is a question for this project, the height of fence is 2.8m, so I suggest It need brace in the middle, do you agree with? Otherwise, I need to change it to 2.2m. But it does not influence strength. In addition, can I design a height of 7m below the crane beam? It’s enough for this project, OK?"</p>
<p>Sound slowly from the phone:"hmm, let me think... , ok, I accept your suggestion ,you re-offer 2.2m and change the height from foundation to crane beam."</p>
<p>Peter:"30mins please, I am sure you will be satisfied with my re-offer about 2.2m and 7m crane."</p>
<p>"ha ha ha, I’m awaiting for my old friend’s gifts."...</p>
<p>During the next 30 mins, Peter with Wendy quickly check the memo which they already prepared to this re-offer, and check every keypoint again, then send message and official email at the same time. </p>
<p>15:10 P.M., Wendy’s whatsApp returned , the re-offer is Ok, "Binggo! Yeap!, Our hard work deserved!" , Wendy shout out. Peter and Wendy celebrated with a high-five, "He should be quite satisfied with this time. We can TNT him some Chinese coffee and tea. Let him introduce more big Thai customers to us. Haha...".</p>
