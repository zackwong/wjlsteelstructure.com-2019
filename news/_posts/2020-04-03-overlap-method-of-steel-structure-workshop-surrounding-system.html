<p>The surrounding system of a <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> warehouse refers to the roof and wall panels of a steel structure warehouse. Generally, the roof and wall panels of a steel structure warehouse are surrounded by color steel plates or color steel sandwich panels, and most of them are used sandwich panel, because the sandwich panel has a good thermal insulation effect and sound insulation effect. Today we talk about the construction overlap method of steel structure color steel plate and color steel sandwich panel.</p>
<p><b>Natural buckle type</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>This is a form of continuation of asbestos tiles and galvanized iron tiles, but the old-style buckle method requires at least a flat wave distance. when use color steel plates as roofing panels, will increase economic indicators if another half wave is overlapped, so many methods are used to overlap a wave. There are some hidden dangers in the waterproofing of the joints of house panels.</p>
<p><b>Waterproof cavity type</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>In this method, a cavity of about 4 mm is formed at two fastening edges. The cavity cuts off the capillary path caused by the attachment of two steel plates. At the same time, the water column in the cavity will balance the indoor and outdoor atmospheric static pressure, and the rain caused by the difference will penetrate the room. This method has been applied to the design of steel structures profile plate section shape.</p>
<p><b>occlusion type</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>The occlusion methods can be divided into 180 째 and 360 째 occlusal methods. This method uses an undercutting machine to bite the two overlapping edges of the board together. 180 째 undercut is a non-tight occlusion, while 360 째 is a tight occlusion. This plate type is an ideal and reliable waterproof plate type, which usually costs more money.</p>
<p><b>Buckle type</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>In this method, two sides are arranged symmetrically, and a bayonet structure edge is made on both sides, and a buckle cover is buckled on it after installation. This method has better waterproof effect.</p>
<p>The above is the construction overlap method of the steel structure factory color steel plate building system. If there is anything wrong, welcome criticism and correction.</p>
