<p>(1) The top of scaffold is higher than 2m, and each external corner is provided with lightning rod.</p>
<p>(2) The grounding wire of the grounding device shall be three conductors, which shall be electrically connected with the grounding body at different points. The vertical grounding body shall be 50 × 5 angle steel, φ 48 steel pipe or φ 22 round steel, with a length of 2.2m. The threaded steel shall not be used, and the grounding resistance shall not be greater than 4 Ω.</p>
<p>2.5.2 Lightning arrester</p>
<p>The lightning arrester is the lightning rod, which can be made of galvanized pipe with a diameter of 25-32mm and a wall thickness of not less than 3mm or galvanized steel bar with a diameter of not less than 12mm. It is set on the scaffold pole at the four corners of the house, with a height of not less than 1m, and the top horizontal pole shall be connected to form a lightning protection network. When installing the lightning rod on the vertical transport frame, the middle vertical rod on one side shall be connected to the top by not less than 2 meters, the lower end of the vertical rod shall be provided with grounding wire, and the shell of the winch shall be grounded.</p>
<p>2.5.3 The grounding wire shall be made of steel as much as possible</p>
<p>The vertical grounding electrode can be made of steel pipe with a length of 1.5-2 meters, a diameter of 25-30 mm, a wall thickness of not less than 2.5 mm, and a round steel or 50 × 5 angle steel with a diameter of not less than 20 mm. For horizontal grounding electrode, round steel with a length of not less than 3m and a diameter of 8-14mm or flat steel with a thickness of not less than 4mm and a width of 25-40mm can be selected. In addition, metal pipes, metal piles, drilling pipes, water suction pipes buried in the ground and metal structures with reliable connection with the earth can also be used as grounding electrodes. One grounding electrode shall be set within 50m according to the continuous length of the scaffold, and the transition resistance of the scaffold within the farthest point from the grounding electrode shall not exceed 10 ohm. The ground resistance shall not exceed 20 ohms. The grounding electrode shall be buried in the highest point of the ground and not less than 50cm below the ground, and the new fill shall be compacted during the embedding. The ground wire shall not be buried in the soil layer near the steam pipeline or chimney air duct which is often hand heated, in the brick cinder or sand above the groundwater level, and in the particularly dry soil layer.</p>
