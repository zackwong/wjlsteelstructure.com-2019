<p>Thunder God Mountain container house hospital</p>
<p>14th February, Valentines day, a very beautiful day for couples. And at that day, we also finished another big step during the war against New-coronary-pneumonia. The Thunder God Mountain container house hospital was finished and all the hero workers came back home. After experiencing more than 30000 steps and 5 hours sleep everyday, they finished 11-day construction assistance mission and can have a good rest now.</p>
<p>4th February, all the hero-workers arrived at Wuhan, and they even didn’t get a rest for one moment and went to the construction site directly to negotiate the relative construction progress. And since 6:00 am at 4th February, all the staffs started the construction. From 6:00 am till 12:00 night, they worked at all the time and even didn’t have one minutes to sit down. And with the effort of all people, it took 3 days to connect water, 4 days to connect electricity and 6 days to connect the air-flow, and all the equipment was finished at 10th February.</p>
<p>The most impressive task during the construction of Thunder God Mountain container house hospital was that: after finished the work in ward area, they accepted the task of public area. Because the pressure of public area is higher, they need to finish it within 3 days. They receive the order at 6:00pm, but after another work, they started at 12:00 pm, and urgently arrange the management staff and tasks and materials. Thanks to everyone's active efforts, and based on the previous experience, it came out in three days.</p>
<p>After 7 days of non-stop work, the Thunder God Mountain Commando successfully completed. The construction of the container house hospital project with a building area of 2,000 square meters passed the acceptance check. Today, the Thunder Mountain Hospital project is already brightly lit. The trunking and bridges are neatly arranged above the roof. Everyone has been able to charge their mobile phones in the house. The team members no longer have to worry about their mobile phones being powered off and shut down; The faucet has been able to deliver warm water continuously; all the air inlets provide fresh air 24 hours a day; each room has also been cleaned and tidy, only ready to be used by doctors and patients.</p>
<p>Today, even the workers, doctors, policemen, civil servant and scientists couldn’t meet their lovers. They are not alone, all the Chinese people stand behind that, and we believe that the New-coronary-pneumonia will be overcome soon and we must win. And at that time, we will hold hands, walk on the street and enjoy the breeze of spring wind and share the prosperous world together.</p>
