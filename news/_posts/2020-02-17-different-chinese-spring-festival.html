<p>Referring to the "Xiaotangshan" hospital model in Beijing, the hospital adopts a <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> building with an overall building area of 25000 square meters, and it can provide 1000 beds. According to the latest design drawings, the total number of beds in huoshenshan hospital is 813 (tentative). The functions of these #steelstructurecontainer rooms mainly include: ward, reception room, ICU, medical technology diagnosis department , network machine room, supply warehouse, waste temporary storage room, ambulance decontamination room, etc. the main structural form is the container movable house of steel structure product series, and the container houses have successively entered the construction site. On January 23, Wuhan announced that it will build a hospital for the centralized treatment of patients with new coronavirus pulmonary inflammation. On January 24, a total of 50000 square meters of the site was leveled. On January 25, in the early morning, the design scheme was completed and the main construction was started.

<p>It is understood that these #steelstructuremovablehouses are not directly built on the ground, but should be assembled after the impervious layer and foundation are poured. They are a new type of reusable material with fast assembly speed, good heat preservation and insulation effect. According to the plan, huoshenshan hospital will be built on February 1st and put into operation on February 3rd , which means that we will build 25000 square meters of #steelstructurehospital in 13 days, which is not a myth, it is a fact, our factory will also join in this action, the workers have returned to the factory in recent days, make a contribution to the country and refuel for China! Cheer for Wuhan!</p>
