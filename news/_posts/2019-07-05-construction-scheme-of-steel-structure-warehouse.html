<p><b>1.2 Material transportation</b></p>
<p>1.2.1 Check the road condition and choose the best transportation route.</p>
<p>1.2.2 All materials should be transported to the site for installation.</p>
<p>1.2.3 Different transport methods should be chosen for different components.</p>
<p>1.2.4 Components should be handled lightly and placed lightly. They should not be picked up, thrown or wrestled sequentially.</p>
<p>1.2.5 Careful loading, reasonable and reliable binding, keep clean, prevent vehicle vibration damage items.</p>
<p>1.2.6 In transportation, storage and construction of components, measures should be taken to prevent damage, deformation and loss.</p>
<p><b>1.3 Nursing, counting, repairing</b></p>
<p>1.3.1 Specialized personnel should be set up to guard against material loss after entering the field.</p>
<p>1.3.2 Before installation, the components should be checked carefully according to the detailed list of the components in the board room, and the missing components should be registered in time for weighing, specification and quantity; the deformed and paint-removed components should be repaired in time; and the dirt, mud and dust on the surface of the objects should be cleaned up in time.</p>
<p><b>1.4 Square Pipe Installation</b>/p>
<p>Strengthen square pipes on site according to the drawings of <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> warehouse provided by Party A. All square pipes are fixed with self-tapping screw.</p>
<p><b>2. Installation of Color Plate in Steel Structure Storehouse</b></p>
<p><b>2.1 Installation of External Wallboard</b></p>
<p>Install the external wall panels according to the layout. Make sure the wall panels are clean before installation.</p>
<p>External wall panels should be installed from left to right.</p>
<p>The joints of exterior wall panels should be directed against the wind.</p>
<p><b>2.2 Window fittings installation</b></p>
<p>Installation sequence: top and bottom receptacles of window sill —→ window frame installation —→ window fan installation —→ window lock hook —→ gluing</p>
<p>Adjust the window frame to make it horizontal, vertical, high and low and flat, adjust the support between columns to make the window frame and the column joint inside and outside uniform.</p>
<p>Glue the seams between the window sill receptacles and the wall panels, the window frames and the columns and the window frames. The windowsill receptacle and wallboard behind the house should be glued, and the protective film should be torn off before gluing. The ends of the windowsill closure shall be sealed with glue.</p>
<p>Install window sash</p>
<p>Install window lock hook. According to the position of the lock hook on the window fan, installing the lock hook on the window cabinet should ensure that the position of the two lock hooks is identical, the installation is firm and the switch is flexible.</p>
<p><b>2.3 Roof installation</b></p>
<p>2.3.1 Construction sequence of steel roof slab: roof, edge receptacles, gluing</p>
<p>2.3.2 Roof tiles and purlins are connected with tapping screws. The row nails are shown below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>Each corrugated roof has a nail, and each tile has a nail in the roof and the middle, at the joint of the tile.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The roof tiles and roof tiles are connected by rivets 4*20. At the intersection of roof tiles and roof corrugates, models should be made and cut with iron shears after marking. As shown in the figure, the cutting size should be matched with the size of the roof corrugates to avoid being too large or too small. Attention should be paid to ensuring that the center of the ridge tile coincides with the vertical center of the roof. After cutting, a rivet should be punched every other corrugation.</p>
<p>Seal the joints and rivets with glass glue.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Rivets are used to connect the side closure of gables with roof tiles and gables. The rivet spacing is 400 mm. The side closure of gables should be lapped along the direction of water flow.</p>
<p>Sealant seals shall be applied to the side-closing joints of gables and rivets.</p>
<p>2.3.5 The seams and rivets of the roof components are pulled and sealed with glass glue for tapping the nails. It is strictly forbidden for people to walk on them.</p>
<p><b>3. Quality requirement</b></p>
<p><b>3.1 Quality Requirements for Installation of Steel Structure Components</b></p>
<p>3.1.1 The surface of steel components is clean and free from oil, mud, sand and dust.</p>
<p>3.1.2 The coating damaged during transportation, storage and installation should be repaired.</p>

<p><b>3.2 Quality Requirements for Installation of Wallboard and Roof Panel</b></p>
<p>3.2.1 Roof tiles and wall panels should be flat and clean, the joints should be straight, the vertical and horizontal overlap joints should be straight, the cornices and the lower end of the wall should be straight, without error drilling, the joints should be even and tightly without warping.</p>
<p>3.2.2 Gables side plate and ridge tiles should be straight, fixed and reliable and no loosening.</p>
<p>3.2.3 The installation allowable deviation shall meet the internal quality inspection standards of the company.</p>
<p><b>b3.3 Allowable deviation of door and window installation</b></p>
<p>3.3.1 Installation of door and window frames should be horizontal and vertical, with the same height and plane.</p>
<p>3.3.2 The connection between frame and column should be firm, without shaking, and the gap should be even.</p>
<p><b>4. Acceptance of work</b></p>
<p><4.1 After the installation of the steel structure warehouse is completed, the construction team should do a comprehensive self-inspection. The self-inspection of the team should be a general inspection, and the problems found in the self-inspection should be dealt with in time./p>
<p>4.2 After the team has passed the self-examination, fill in the self-examination record and report it to the supervisor.</p>
<p>4.3 The supervisor shall organize relevant personnel to carry out inspection and acceptance according to the situation of self-inspection. Inspection and acceptance should be the combination of general inspection and sampling inspection. Notify the team to deal with the problems detected in time. After qualified, the supervisor and relevant personnel sign the acceptance certificate of steel structure warehouse, which serves as the basis for the team to settle wages and complete the installation of the board house.</p>
<p>4.4 Small-scale projects are managed by the director (medium-sized projects by the installation manager, large-scale projects by the company's production manager). Users and relevant personnel are invited to carry out the acceptance and acceptance of the work between Party A and Party B. The problems raised by Party A shall be dealt with separately according to the specific circumstances. Hand over acceptance slip after qualified.</p>
<p>4.5 Quality inspection should run through the whole production process. Inspectors at all levels should take the initiative to work ahead, eliminate quality problems in the bud, and try not to "post-mortem autopsy".</p>
<p>4.6 After acceptance, the acceptance results will be recorded in detail (self-inspection records, acceptance slips) and filed for reference.</p>
