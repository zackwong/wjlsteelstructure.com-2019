<p>The deepening of <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> design is to deepen the design so that the drawings can be expressed detailedly, and the connection joints meet the design requirements and installation requirements, so that the project can be implemented smoothly. It not only includes the content to be expressed in the design, but also issues such as material supply, transportation, installation method and sequence concerned by the construction contractor, and partly assumes the role of project consultation.</p>
<p>Main content of deepening design</p>
<p>1. Simulation analysis of the whole construction process</p>
<p>The simulation analysis of the whole construction process has been applied earlier in the construction fields of large bridges and hydropower buildings. With the increasing number of large-scale civil projects, construction simulation has gradually become an indispensable content for large complex projects.</p>
<p>2. Structural design optimization</p>
<p>In the simulation modeling analysis, as for the calculation model of the original structural design and the calculation model considering the whole construction process, although the final situation is same, during the construction process due to construction support or construction temperature and other reasons, stress distortion occurs, However the stress generated from components and joints during construction couldnâ€™t disappear as the structure's geometric size is restored to the design situation , and it is usually partially retained, which affects the safety of the structure during its lifetime.</p>
<p>3. Joints deepening</p>
<p>The connection joints of ordinary steel structure mainly include: column foot joints, support base joints, beam-column connections, beam-beam connections, truss chord and web connections, and bolt-ball joints, welded ball joints, steel pipe space intersecting joints, Multi-members interchanging cast steel joints in space structure, as well as cable connection joins, cable tension joints, and cable penetration joints, etc in pre-stressed steel structures. The design of the above-mentioned various joins belongs to the scope of construction drawings. The main content of joints deepening refers to the welding strength verification, bolt group verification, on-site splicing joints connection calculation, joints design construction feasibility review and complex joints space lofting for the unmentioned joints in drawing according to the design principles of construction drawings.</p>
<p>4. Members Installation Drawing</p>
<p>The installation drawing is used to guide the site installation, positioning and connection. The main task of the installation drawing is to install each components to the correct position and connect it in correct way after the component processing is completed.</p>
<p>5. Members Productions Drawing</p>
<p>The members processing drawing is the production drawing of the factory, which is the basis for factory processing, and also the basis for factory acceptance inspection. Members processing drawings can be subdivided into large members drawings and part members drawings.</p>
<p>With the development of CNC machine tools and related control software, parts drawings are gradually replaced by computer automatic lofting. At present, the line cutting has basically realized paperless production. And  as for ordinary steel structure production, some domestic advanced processing enterprises have gradually trended to adopt computer automatic nesting, blanking and processing.</p>
<p>6. Engineering quantity analysis</p>
<p>In members processing drawings, the materials table is easily to be ignored. But it is an important part of deepening detailed drawing. It contains the components, parts, bolt numbers, and the corresponding specifications, quantities, sizes, weights and materials information. This information is very helpful for the correct understanding of the drawings, and it is easy to get the exact purchasing information needed. By summarizing and categorizing these material tables, material procurement plans and installation plans can be quickly formulated, which provides great convenience for project management.</p>
