<p>This building was designed by one famous architect Zaha Hadid, she was Inspired by jade ornaments. The Morpheus Hotel is the world's first skyscraper with a free-form exoskeleton <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a>. The hollow part of the building is designed with the word "8". The hotel contains approximately 770 five-star rooms, suites and villas.The internal space is mainly based on contemporary design, including three pool villas and six duplex villas. Upon arrival at the hotel, passengers can clearly see the hollow design from the lobby up to 35 meters high. The 12 panoramic sightseeing elevators in the atrium lobby also allow passengers to navigate through the hollow structure and enjoy the view of the atrium lobby and the exterior of the building.</p>
<p>When the drawing was released, this hotel has been judged as almost impossible to build. Because the hotel needs to install 48,000 square meters of glass,Enough to mount 120,000 Mona Lisa's smile! It need 70500 ㎡ of reinforced concrete,Enough to build over 28 Olympic standard swimming pools!It also needs 28,000 tons of steel structure,The equivalent of four Eiffel towers!So the designer Zaha Hadid was ridiculed and dissed. However at today, it was finished, and successfully become the newest landmark building. At the opening ceremony, everyone came here, but the main designer Zaha Hadid was absent. Zaha must have gone to heaven to build a house, there is no limit or discrimination. It was not until Zhaha died that people gradually realized that they had treated such an incomparably strong architect with such cruelty.On the day of Zaha’s departure, a female graduate student of the Wu Da Architecture Department wrote in the circle of friends, “My lighthouse is gone.”</p>
<p>Zaha Hadid is a very famous architect, she was born in 1950s and studied in UK. She loved design and architect since she was very young influenced by her neighbors and her mother. So they moved to UK to support her architect career. While she was a student, zaha's maverick personality began to emerge. Hardy hated sameness.,she liked to push boundaries and break rules.She was praised by her teacher, and was called “Planets with their own unique orbits”. After graduation, she opened her own company for design. Her fanciful designs have been noticed and praised again and again, but never really implemented. She became an architectural designer with only "works on paper".Till 1993, when she was 43 years-old, she owned her first work-Tokyo Olympic building. After that, she constantly owns few famous buildings, such as SOHO building in Beijing and beautiful theater in Guangzhou. Even some people still didn’t understand her,she win the appreciation from lots of people.Zhaha’s life is brave, resolutely determined, fearless of the world, and he has become the kind of person he really wants to become. She can finally realize her life’s wishes:"My building belongs to the future!</p>

<p>Of course, Steel structure building is never the traditional and regular one. The special design and flexible pattern is warmly welcomed. It can not only achieve this building, but also leave some amazing work to the generations. The steel structure building was disputed in the history, developed in ancient time, and will become more prosperous in the future.</p>
