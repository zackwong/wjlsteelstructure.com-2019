<p><a href="{{ site.url }}">Steel structure</a> manufacturing is mainly divided into two parts: one is H-type steel beam and column processing.</p>
<p>H-type steel beam and column processing: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2.1 Lofting: The professional lofting worker is required to accurately loft on the processing surface and assembly large sample plate during every construction process, such as steel sheet lofting and cutting, H-steel assemblage, assembly of various components and parts, components pre-assembly. After the Lofting, it must be inspected by the inspector to make sure the accurateness of geometrical dimensions of the parts and components, the shape and position difference, the angle, the installation contact surface, etc.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2.2 Scribing and Making-off: For the smaller-sized plates and rods, the manual scribing and making-off are used in the case of unnecessary CNC cutting. The scribing and making-off personnel should be skilled in making prototypes and sample rods, familiar with the symbols and texts marked on the prototypes and sample rods, and figure out the quantity of the materials.</p>
<p>2.3 Laying-off （including beveling）: including gas cutting, shearing and beveling. The main equipment for laying-out and cutting of our company include Isa-Hancock plasma, flame multi-head CNC cutting machine, trolley type flame cutting machine, horizontal band sawing machine, beveling machine and shearing machine. Correct the steel plate or profile with a straightening machine before cutting. For welded steel plates or H-beams, inspection and flaw detection must also be carried out.Only when it is qualified,the cutting can be processed. The processing requirements shall be based on the company's internal control standards to inspect the cutting surface, geometrical dimensions, shape tolerances, incision sections, spatters, etc. After the inspection is qualified, Stack them reasonably, make the qualified mark and put the components number.</p>
<p>The main precision requirements for Laying-out the cutting are shown as below:</p>

<p>2.9 Hole making: The parts of the steel structure are accurately mechanical drilled by a universal rock drill . The components are drilled by a three-dimensional drill or a magnetic drill with a scribe line and a template. In order to ensure the accuracy and quality of the drilling,the reference axis and center of hold should be laid out by loft man during the mold drill. For CNC machining,only when the first processed product was qualified by inspector,can it be drilled in batches. The parts, components must be inspected and qualified after welding by the inspector firstly, then it can be moved to another procedures.</p>

<p>2.10 Correction: The correction work runs through the whole processing of steel structure fabrication, from preparation to laying-off, submerged arc welding, assembly and manual welding, etc., to ensure that the size, quality and shape of the components meet the requirements of the specification. At present, the methods of correction mainly include automatic correction, flame correction, etc. The main equipment adopted is H-beam straightening machine.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-9.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2.11 Friction surface treatment: the end of components’ joint friction surfaces should be milled by a milling machine, and the friction surface is treated by a shot blasting machine to treat the surface friction degree, which naturally causes floating rust. At the same time, the test specimen should be made of should be made of the same material and processing method.And it should be tested by the friction coefficient test to ensure that the friction coefficient meets the specified requirements.</p>
<p>2.12 Surface treatment of components: After processing, the parts and components shall be edge-processed according to the regulations to remove burrs, welding slag, welding spatter, dirt, etc.and be inspected on surface. After the products are finished and the surface is removed, the surface derusting treatment is performed by a shot blasting machine. The descaling level should be above Sa2.5.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/news/{{ page.image }}-10.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
<p>2.13Paint:After derusting,the components should be cleaned immediately and sprayed with anti-rust primer. The requirements of the paint should be in accordance with the design regulations. The paint process should be carried out according to the operation instructions and the corresponding paint and instruction manual. The ambient temperature and humidity are controlled by a temperature and humidity meter to ensure compliance with the requirements of the corresponding paint process. The thickness of the spray is controlled by the thickness gauge. The thickness of each paint should be controlled according to the instruction manual. After the paint,It should be marked by specified person according to the requirements of the drawings. The main marks and signs of the components are the assembly number, the height reference point, the assembly center line of the reference line, the hanging points and others. The main equipment adopts is high pressure airless paint spraying machine.</p>
<p>2.14 Acceptance: When the number of finished products reaches the requirements of a cross-test assembly, a trial assembly shall be carried out in the factory under the guidance of technical and quality engineers to check the overall quality and installation of the components to ensure smooth installation on site. At the same time, the inspection and test results should be inspected by the full-time inspector. After the above inspections are passed, the certificates shall be affixed to the components for packaging and delivery.</p>
<p><b>3. Safety work During steel structure manufacturing</b></p>
