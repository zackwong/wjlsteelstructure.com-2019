On the 103rd floor, there is a watchtower for tourists to overlook the city. It is 412 meters above the ground and can be seen in four states in the United States when the weather is fine.</p>
<p>The building uses steel structure frame to form a beam structure. The whole building is regarded as a cantilevered beam space structure. The farther away from the ground, the smaller the shear force, the vibration at the top of the building caused by wind pressure is also significantly reduced. This greatly enhances the building's rigidity and ability to resist lateral forces.</p>
<p>No.5: Kuala Lumpur Twin Towers</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ page.title }}"></p>
