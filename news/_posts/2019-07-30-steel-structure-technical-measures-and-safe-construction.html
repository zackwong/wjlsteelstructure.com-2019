<p><b>1. Quality Assurance Measures</b></p>
<p>In the quality management of <a href="{{ site.url }}">steel structure</a> construction, quality supervision and process control should be carried out in strict accordance with the relevant national standards and norms, to ensure that each process is controlled, specifically the following measures:</p>
<p>1.1 Establish a comprehensive quality management system, organize various standardized learning, and regularly organize and promote successful experiences.</p>
<p>1.2 Establish a sample guiding route. All professional steel structure construction must be carried out in accordance with the design standards at the beginning.</p>
<p>1.3 Establish a quality inspection team. Each professional construction team shall have quality inspectors. Each process must check the quality of the previous process and be responsible for the next process to ensure that each process is controlled.</p>
<p>1.4 Strengthen technical management, each sub-project must be technically delivered, and take out the construction plan for each process.</p>
<p>1.5 Establish a material inspection system. All materials and auxiliary materials must have complete material reports, specifications, certificates, etc., and must be reviewed and approved for approval, and Party A and the supervisors agree.</p>
<p>1.6 Do a good job in the acceptance of the project and the acceptance record of the concealed project. The concealed project must be reported to the owner and the rational engineer for inspection and confirmation.</p>
<p>1.7 Establish a regular construction system, actively participate in the production scheduling meeting organized by the owners, and we also organize daily scheduling meetings to promptly propose and eliminate quality hazards.</p>
<p>1.8 Establish a reward and punishment system, rewarding fine and bad.</p>
<p>1.9 Establish file of workers of special types of work, and it is strictly forbidden to work without a certificate.</p>
<p>1.10 Prepare professional steel structure construction technical measures, electric welders, painters, etc. must be constructed in accordance with the operating procedures.</p>
<p><b>2. Process coordination measures</b></p>
<p>Due to the large number of steel structure construction procedures and frequent cross-operations, the coordination between the various processes is very important to ensure the quality of the project and shorten the construction period. In order to facilitate the smooth progress of the project, the following measures are taken:</p>
<p>2.1 In the construction preparation stage, the person in charge of the site prepares a detailed plan for the connection of each process, comprehensively considers the factors affecting the cross-operation between the various processes, and proposes a solution.</p>
<p>2.2 The site manager shall arrange the operation plans of each construction team in a unified manner. Each construction team shall propose problems that may arise in the cross-operation, and the person in charge of the site shall formulate corresponding solutions for these problems.</p>
<p>2.3 Each sub-item of steel structure engineering shall be constructed according to the principle of bottom-up. Before the next process is not accepted, the construction of the previous process shall not be carried out to reduce rework and speed up the construction progress.</p>

<p><b>3. On-site civilized construction measures</b></p>
<p>Civilized construction is an important aspect of showing the image of the construction team and showing the quality of the construction team. The steel structure project is a window for external display and comprehensive planning.</p>
<p>3.1 Basic requirements</p>

<p>Lighting and hand-held lighting fixtures in hazardous wet locations must use voltages that meet safety requirements.</p>
<p>3.3 Construction Machinery</p>
<p>The location of the construction machinery or the route of the construction shall comply with the provisions of the construction plane position map, and shall not arbitrarily encroach on the road inside the yard.</p>
<p>3.4 The site must be clean, tidy and orderly.</p>
<p>3.5 Steel structure construction site Temporary roads are used to harden the ground, and wheel washing equipment is installed at the entrance and exit to prevent the soil on the wheels from being taken out of the field.</p>
<p>3.6 On-site maintenance and maintenance of all curing agents to make the construction site clean and tidy.</p>
<p><b>4. Environmental protection measures at the construction site</b></p>
<p>Measures to prevent pollution and soil erosion:</p>
<p>Drainage facilities such as temporary drainage ditch shall be provided on both sides of the building to prevent soil erosion. The wastewater in the construction life should be treated by sedimentation. The waste residue, garbage and spoil should be disposed of properly and piled up at the designated place. It is strictly forbidden to throw away the litter and avoid polluting the environment. After the completion of the construction, in addition to the consent of the owner, all production and living facilities must be dismantled and thoroughly cleaned to restore the original appearance.</p>
<p><b>5. Construction site maintenance measures</b></p>
<p>5.1 The distribution of the site is reasonable and orderly. The appearance of the site is neat and civilized. The construction area is strictly separated from the living area. The material areas are piled up neatly and safety protection measures are taken.</p>
<p>5.2 Set a prominent safety warning sign in the construction area and hazardous area.</p>
<p>5.3 The site is to be three-way and one-level, and the drainage is smooth.</p>
<p>5.4 Set the engineering project board, the name and name of the project responsible person, and the safety technical measures signage at the main entrances and exits of the construction site.</p>

When the components are hoisted, the slings must be tied firmly. The rope buckles must be locked in the hooks. It is strictly forbidden to use the hooks to hook the components. The components are not allowed to be used before they are stable at high altitude.</p>
<p>7.9.5 In the hoisting area of the crane, non-operators are strictly forbidden to enter, and the pole is not allowed to stand vertically below. When hoisting, the operator's energy should be concentrated and obey the command order, and illegal work is strictly prohibited. Lifting operations should be done "five not hanging":</p> 
<p>A. The gesture command is unclear and not hanging.</p>
