<p>3.1 Choice of installation plan</p>
<p>Compare a variety of installation plans, organize the expert demonstrations, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the project combined with the structure characteristics, construction period, construction site conditions and other factors, and select the best plan, that is, the entire stadium hood steel structure construction is divided into two construction areas, respectively for the Western District and Eastern District. In order to speed up the construction progress, two 150-ton crawler cranes are arranged on the outside of the stadium, and one 80-ton truck crane is arranged in the inside of the stadium. Each construction area is hoisted from the middle to both sides. After hoisting the steel structure in the west area, hoist the steel structure in the east area.</p>
